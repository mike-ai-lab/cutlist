# 3D Assembly Viewer - Quick Start Guide

## How to Use

### Step 1: Generate a Cut List Report
1. Open your SketchUp model with components
2. Select the components you want to analyze
3. Click **AutoNestCut** → **Generate Cut List**
4. Configure materials and settings
5. Click **Process** to generate the report

### Step 2: Open the 3D Assembly Viewer
1. In the report dialog, look for the **"3D Assembly"** button (🔧 icon)
2. Click the button
3. A new window opens showing your complete 3D assembly

### Step 3: Interact with the Assembly

#### Camera Controls
| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Rotate | Left-click drag |
| Pan | Middle-click drag OR Shift+Left-click drag |
| Zoom | Mouse scroll wheel |

#### Component Selection
- **Click** any component in the 3D view to highlight it
- **Click** any component in the list on the right sidebar
- Selected components turn **green** with a glow effect
- Camera automatically zooms to selected component

#### View Controls
| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Reset View | Return to full assembly view |
| Wireframe | Toggle wireframe rendering |
| Solid | Show components as solid |
| Transparent | Show components as semi-transparent |
| Toggle (Lighting) | Turn lighting effects on/off |

### Step 4: View Assembly Information

The right sidebar shows:
- **Total Components**: Number of parts in assembly
- **Total Parts**: Total part instances
- **Materials**: Number of different materials
- **Assembly Bounds**: Width, height, depth measurements
- **Component List**: All components with dimensions and materials

## Tips & Tricks

### Viewing Specific Components
1. Scroll through the component list on the right
2. Click any component name
3. The 3D view zooms to that component
4. Component is highlighted in green

### Examining Assembly Structure
1. Use **Wireframe** mode to see component edges
2. Use **Transparent** mode to see through components
3. Rotate the view to see internal structure
4. Zoom in on specific areas for detail

### Optimizing Performance
- For large assemblies, use **Transparent** mode
- Disable **Lighting** if performance is slow
- Use **Wireframe** mode for faster rendering
- Zoom to specific components instead of viewing entire assembly

### Taking Screenshots
1. Position the assembly as desired
2. Use your OS screenshot tool (Print Screen, Cmd+Shift+3, etc.)
3. The 3D view will be captured

## Troubleshooting

### Assembly Not Showing
- **Solution**: Click "Reset View" button
- **Alternative**: Close and reopen the viewer

### Components Appear Incorrectly Positioned
- **Solution**: Verify components in SketchUp are properly positioned
- **Alternative**: Regenerate the cut list report

### Slow Performance
- **Solution**: Use Transparent or Wireframe mode
- **Alternative**: Disable Lighting
- **Alternative**: Zoom to specific components

### Can't Select Components
- **Solution**: Make sure you're clicking directly on a component
- **Alternative**: Use the component list on the right sidebar

### Colors Look Wrong
- **Solution**: Colors are auto-generated based on material names
- **Alternative**: This is normal behavior
