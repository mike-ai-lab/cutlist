# Getting Started

This page helps you get AutoNestCut up and running and produce your first cut list and nesting diagram.

## Before you begin

- SketchUp knowledge: basic use of components and the Entity Selection tools is assumed.
- Prepare your model so each sheet-good part is a distinct component (instances are fine).

## Quick walkthrough

1. Open your SketchUp project and ensure parts you want included are components with realistic dimensions (thickness between ~3–50mm).
2. Apply materials to components where relevant — AutoNestCut uses material names and attributes to match stock.
3. Select the components you want to include (optional — leaving nothing selected processes the whole model).
4. Launch AutoNestCut from the Extensions menu or toolbar.
5. Configure kerf, rotation rules and stock materials in the dialog, then click Generate.
6. Review the interactive report and export CSV or PDF if needed.

If you prefer a quick start cheat-sheet, the root `README.md` also has a concise quick start section.
